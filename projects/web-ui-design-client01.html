                    A colleague of mine based in Canada approached me for a <span class="highlight">UI design</span>
                    role for his clients' website
                    redesign. The goal was to establish an improved updated, modern look and feel for the website inline
                    with their updated vision, target market and growing opportunities inside the company. Alongside
                    improving its usability and optimize content presentation.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        Before beginning the design process, I conducted thorough research to understand user
                        expectations and industry
                        standards within the local construction and development sector. I looked into websites of
                        business partners and specific <span class="highlight">competitors</span>
                        to identify common design patterns and opportunities for differentiation.<br><br>
                        To establish a strong
                        visual direction for me and my colleague, I curated references from <span
                            class="highlight">Pinterest</span> focusing on
                        layout, color harmony, and
                        imagery style.
                        Additionally, the client provided a reference website, which helped ensure our
                        design direction
                        were well aligned.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        With the research insights in mind, I began sketching low-fidelity wireframes to restructure the
                        site’s layout and
                        create a more intuitive navigation experience. The primary focus was on enhancing readability,
                        ensuring content clarity
                        and establishing a smooth user-friendly flow.
                        <br><br>
                        After aligning with the client on the initial concepts, I developed high-fidelity wireframes in
                        <span class="highlight">Figma</span>, incorporating the
                        brand’s color palette, typography, and imagery inspired by our visual references. The refined
                        design introduced a
                        simplified information hierarchy, clear navigation and prominent call-to-action
                        areas.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        One of the main challenges arose from the client’s preference for a <span
                            class="highlight">content management system
                            (CMS)</span>
                        that would allow them to
                        easily update content and publish blogs independently. To meet this requirement, my
                        colleague recommended
                        using <span class="highlight">WordPress</span> as the CMS paired with the <span
                            class="highlight">DIVI Theme Builder</span>, a setup that was new to me.
                        <br><br>
                        Instead of viewing this as a limitation, I approached it as an exciting opportunity to learn and
                        adapt. I
                        spent time exploring
                        both tools, experimenting with layout customization in DIVI, and testing how closely I could
                        translate my Figma-approved
                        wireframes within WordPress’s framework.
                        <br><br>
                        Through this process, I learned to customize DIVI
                        beyond standard
                        modules and implement my design system within the platform.
                        In the end, I was able to faithfully recreate the approved design while ensuring the client
                        retained full control over
                        their content.

                <p class="project-text">
                    During the development phase, my colleague and I worked closely to implement the final design using
                    <span class="highlight">WordPress</span> with the
                    <span class="highlight">DIVI Theme Builder</span>, ensuring strong alignment with the approved Figma
                    prototypes. His guidance was
                    instrumental,
                    particularly as he introduced me to several new tools such as <span class="highlight">XAMPP</span>
                    for local testing and <span class="highlight">GitHub</span>
                    for version
                    control, which significantly enhanced my technical workflow and <span
                        class="highlight">understanding of the development
                        process.</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Together, we used XAMPP to test the site locally, assessing responsiveness, browser compatibility,
                    and overall
                    performance before deployment. The testing phase was highly collaborative: we reviewed user
                    navigation and flow while I refined
                    typography, spacing, and accessibility, and incorporated <span class="highlight">client
                        feedback</span> across multiple iterations.
                    This teamwork
                    ensured that the final build met both functional and aesthetic expectations.
                    <br><br>
                    Version control was managed through GitHub, allowing us to maintain clear documentation, <span
                        class="highlight">track
                        revisions</span> efficiently,
                    and collaborate seamlessly throughout development. My colleague’s ongoing support and technical
                    insights were invaluable
                    in creating a smooth, organized and well-executed development process.
